## THIS IS A LIST OF STUFF YOU CAN ADD TO YOUR .bashrc TO MAKE LIFE REALLY EASY!

## A personal rm  function that protects you from accidentally doing rm *
## I often, in my hurry to finish something, type something like 
## rm /path/prefix_ *
##				   ^
function rm() {
  python /Users/arjun/temp/test_fix_rm.py $@
  if [ $? -eq 1 ]
  then
    echo "ERROR: You lose 1 programmer point for running rm *"
    return 1
  fi
  /bin/rm $@
}
